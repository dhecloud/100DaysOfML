# 100 Days Of ML Code

### Day 0: 7 June 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on understanding dlib's extract layer and wrote some testing code to figure out how offset in the parameters affected the output.

**Thoughts:** Took longer than expected for this portion of the code due to the lack of familiarity of c++ and help from dlib's community (unlike python's pytorch/tensorflow) Hope to get this done ASAP.

### Day 1: 8 June 2018

**Today's Progress**: Managed to implement dlib's extract layer. However i am changing from dlib to caffe for my implementation so will stop on implementing dlib. Spent some time installing caffe Revived my old DotA predictor project since i think i make it better. 

**Thoughts:** Even though past weeks of efforts studying dlib were wasted, pretty happy that i get to go back to python. Also wish building libraries on windows was easier.. Quite surprised by the amount of resources available for getting data for DotA.
