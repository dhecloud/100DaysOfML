# 100 Days Of ML Code

### Day 0: 7 June 2018

**Today's Progress**: Worked on understanding dlib's extract layer and wrote some testing code to figure out how offset in the parameters affected the output.

**Thoughts:** Took longer than expected for this portion of the code due to the lack of familiarity of c++ and help from dlib's community (unlike python's pytorch/tensorflow) Hope to get this done ASAP.

**Link to work:** [Commit](https://github.com/dhecloud/Hand-Pose-for-Rheumatoid-Arthritis/commit/b982bb94a330a486e6ae90e208f7c562e1b4c966)
